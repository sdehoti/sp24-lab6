Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 8?
* The main idea is that functions are just objects like anything else and we can just name and store them as variables or some other operations
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
* Closures are a bit confusing.

Write a short summary of what you did (which exercises) below.
* Ex. 1: env_get() traverses through the env variables until it finds a match and returns the list that is associated with it. env_set() checks whether the global variable already exists and if not, adds it to the list of global variables.
